A list of software and hardware I use daily as a design student and software developer.



### Software

As a developer, I am interested in trying new software, but I also strive to create the best possible workflow for myself. Through a couple of years of trying out a bunch of different apps, I came up with the following software that I use almost every day:

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Apple Calendar]()
- [Apple Reminder]()
- [Apple Notes]()
- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/)
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
- Rectangle (for adjusting windows on MacOS)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/de-de)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/de/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)   
- [Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so/)
- [Eagle](https://eagle.cool/)
