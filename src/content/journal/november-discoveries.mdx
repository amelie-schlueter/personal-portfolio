### Technology
This month i discovered a lot of technology that inspired my to start deep diving into developing again. I had a lot of fun with getting a deeper understanding of how NextJs works.  
- [Obsidian Markdown](https://obsidian.md/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/)
- [Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so/)

I also got back into writing by using obsidian again. Obsidian is an amazing writing tool that allows you to link your thoughts together just as they are in your brain. Obsidian allows me to create ideas organicly and aligned with the way my thoughts evolve in my brain
