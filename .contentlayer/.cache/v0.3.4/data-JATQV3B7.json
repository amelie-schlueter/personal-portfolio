Don't get me wrong theres nothing wrong with chaising your dreams and work for them. But more often or not i found people \nnot really trying things out and doing new stuff. Especially after school you are free and you can decide where you want to spend your time (which you can do later as well of course), but many people \njust start the path they decided 5 years ago without even thinking about something else. I did not know what wanted to do exactly after school. You know i was quite sporty my whole life to maybe something in that area? \nOr rather something where i can earn a lot of money and make a huge carriere? But i also want to stay near my hometown to hold contact with family and friends. \nAll of that were thoughts i had. But i was not really thinking about just doing new stuff to explore new areas which i enjoy but did not knew at that time. We humans always \nthrive for the things we know.

I had a lot of fun getting a deeper understanding of how Next.js works.  \n- [Obsidian Markdown](https://obsidian.md/)\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)\n- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/)\n- [Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so/)\n- [Cron](https://cron.com/)\n\nI also got back into writing by using Obsidian again. Obsidian is an amazing writing tool that allows you to link your thoughts together just as they are in your brain. Obsidian allows me to create ideas organically and align with the way my thoughts evolve in my brain.\n\n--- \n\n### People\nI deep-dived more into the design community on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). I discovered a few very inspiring and interesting people that I would like to share because I think they are doing great work. \n- [Rauno Freiberg](https://rauno.me/)\n- [Alex Carpenter](https://alexcarpenter.me/) \n- [Linus Rogge](https://linusrogge.com/)\n- [Anton Stallbörger](https://antonstallboerger.com/)\n- [Florian Kiem](https://floriankiem.com/)\n- [Nils Eller](https://www.nilseller.com/)\n- [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/)\n\nand many more...\n\n---\n\n### Resources\nResources I discovered this month that I find interesting, inspiring, or just beautiful. \n- [Invisible Details of Interaction Design by Rauno Freiberg](https://rauno.me/craft/interaction-design)\n    - A super interesting elaboration on small details that separate amazing interactions from the average ones.\n- [The Road to Becoming Obsidian's CEO - Interview with Stephen Ango](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z58FsjT-UO8)\n- [The Remove lists > goals and visions](https://www.0xshapeshifter.dev/journal/removelist)\n",
