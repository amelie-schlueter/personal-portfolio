What i mean by that is that a lot of people assume they have a specific path they need to follow because \nthats the thing they always dreamed of since they where kids. Don't get me wrong theres nothing wrong with chaising your dreams and work for them. But more often or not i found people \nnot really trying things out and doing new stuff. Especially after school you are free and you can decide where you want to spend your time (which you can do later as well of course), but many people \njust start the path they decided 5 years ago without even thinking about something else. \n\nI did not know what wanted to do exactly after school. You know i was quite sporty my whole life to maybe something in that area? \nOr rather something where i can earn a lot of money and make a huge carriere? But i also want to stay near my hometown to hold contact with family and friends. All of that were thoughts i had. But i was not really thinking about just doing new stuff to explore new areas which i enjoy but did not knew at that time. We humans always \nthrive for the things we know. We are scared of uncertenty and new things. Thats why a lot of childs gravitate towards the job path of there parents or other adulds they know. \n\nI want to make clear how important it is to take the time and have the brave to try out new things. Explore new fields, do things you are not good at right now. Often times we \navoid activities we are not good at. \"Oh no thanks.. i am not a good swimmer..\", \"No, i don't want to learn design. I am not creative.\", \"I can never be a software engineer because i am not good at math..\". \nYou know what? You can do all of those things. \n\nThe point is, It's hard for us to judge whether we enjoy something or whether we're good at something if we never try it because we think we're not cut out for it or can't be good at something for some reason that someone in our young life told us. It breaks my heart to see \nhow many friends taking carrere choices they are not happy with just because they do not know whats there passion or what they are good at, but at the same time \nare to afraid to try new things. \n\n \n ### Why we are afraid of trying new things. \n\nBut i assume many of you heart that you should explore new things, learn new languages and skills, discover new parts of the world and so on. But why are we often \nto afraid to really do it? If course there are many individual reasons why we stay in out comfort zone but one i see really often is the fear of failure. \n\nFor a long time i thought that my worth as a human is closely related to the things i archieve or the the praise that I get from others. I felt ashamed when i was not \ngood at something and regardless of what it was i always wanted to win. Therefore i avoided every situation where i knew i would not be good at something. This probaply \ncame from the passion for soccer i had since i was young, so i grew up in a constand battle and comparrision with other football players. But ironicly after school, i stopped playing \nsoccer as well and because i never really had done other things i did not really what to do with my life. Not only with my work life but also with my freetime.\n\nI'd never took the time to spend time learning new skills or exploring other passions that i was left with a void. I was deeply afraid of looking like i was not good at something that \nin the end i was. \n\n",
