### Technology
This month, I discovered a lot of technology that inspired me to start deep diving into development again. I had a lot of fun getting a deeper understanding of how Next.js works.  
- [Obsidian Markdown](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/)
- [Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so/)
- [Cron](https://cron.com/)

I also got back into writing by using Obsidian again. Obsidian is an amazing writing tool that allows you to link your thoughts together just as they are in your brain. Obsidian allows me to create ideas organically and align with the way my thoughts evolve in my brain.
